# Banking Projects

## üìå Overview
This repository showcases various data science projects focused on banking and financial services. Each project applies machine learning techniques to solve key challenges in banking, such as loan approval, credit risk assessment, and customer churn prediction.

## üè¶ Projects

### 1. Personal Loan Campaign Targeting
**Objective:** Predict potential liability customers who are likely to purchase a personal loan.

**Techniques:** Classification models (Random Forest, Boosting, Bagging)

**Key Insights:**
- Customers with an income of ‚â§ $116,500 are more likely to purchase personal loans.
- Higher education levels impact the likelihood of loan uptake.
- Owning a Certificate of Deposit account increases the probability of loan interest.
- Geographic location and the number of credit cards have minimal impact on loan purchases.

### 2. Credit Card Approval
**Objective:** Develop a system to predict credit card approval based on customer financial data.

**Techniques:** Conditional functions, loops, and rule-based scoring

**Key Insights:**
- Credit score is influenced by payment history (high impact) and credit utilization ratio (high impact).
- Customers with more than two credit cards need special consideration.
- Debt status is a critical factor in approval likelihood.

### 3. German Credit Risk Analysis
**Objective:** Predict loan default risk based on demographic and socio-economic factors.

**Techniques:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Selection (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest, GBM, Adaboost, XGBoost, Decision Trees), Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

**Key Insights:**
- Customers with low savings/checking account balances are more likely to default.
- Higher loan amounts and longer loan durations increase default risk.
- Renters and younger customers have a higher probability of defaulting.

### 4. Credit Card Churn Rate Prediction
**Objective:** Identify factors leading to customer churn in credit card services.

**Techniques:** Oversampling/Undersampling, Model Validation (Bagging, Random Forest, GBM, Adaboost, Decision Trees), Hyperparameter Tuning

**Key Insights:**
- Customers with high transaction counts and amounts are more likely to churn.
- High total revolving balances indicate a higher churn risk.
- A sharp increase in transactions from Q1 to Q4 signals potential churn.
- Older customers are more likely to leave.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Random Forest, Boosting, Bagging, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Adaboost)
- **Feature Engineering & Data Processing** (EDA, Train/Test Split, Hyperparameter Tuning, GridSearchCV, Confusion Matrix Analysis)
- **Classification Models** (for loan approvals, churn prediction, and risk assessment)

## üìà Business Impact
